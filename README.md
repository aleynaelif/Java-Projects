 The projects that I developed during the mobile app development course
 
This file includes several different projects developed for educational purposes. 

Project 1 - Cathcing Game
 It's a simple game. The user tries to score by clicking on the image. If the user score, he/she gets points. But there is also a timer. Therefore user should click on the image before the picture disappears. I used a grid layout which has 9 images of Bojack. And randomly 8 of this images disappears so user can't click on them. Only one of the images is visible. When the timer is over, user can't click on anything. If user wants to play again, he/she can select the yes button in the window that pops open when the game ends. Yes button starts the game from the beginning. But if user selects the no option, the litte message in the bottom says game is over.
