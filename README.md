# Java Projects
 The projects that I developed during the mobile app development course
 
This file includes several different projects developed for educational purposes. 

- Cathcing Game

 It's a simple game. The user tries to score by clicking on the image. But there is a countdown so player should click on the picture before it disappears. Player also should be quick because picture appears randomly. If player clicks fast enough then he/she gets points.I used a grid layout which has 9 images of Bojack. And randomly 8 of this images disappears so user can't click on them. Only one of the images is visible. When the time is over, player can't click on anything. If user wants to play again, he/she can select the yes button in the window that pops open when the game ends. Yes button starts the game from the beginning. But if user selects the no option, the little message in the bottom says game is over.

- Favorite Sitcom Characters 

 This application lists my favorite sitcom characters. Clicking on the characters shows the character's photo, the show's name, and his/her name. Project includes singleton, recycleView, view binding.
 
 - Favorite Albums
 
  This applications helps the user with keeping the list of their favorite albums. The user can save the information of the albums and then view them all together. Using button at the top right corner, user can save the album's cover photo, the artist's name, and the year of release. When user click on the albums listed on the main page, app can display the information has already entered. This project includes permission control, recyclerView, SOLite.
 
- Maps

This is a simple application for learning how to include google maps into a project. User can save places on the map and make list of him/his own. After saving, user can view the saved places in the map again whenever its needed. This project includes RxJava and Room. 

- Instagram Clone

This project is a basic implementation of the app which is called instagram. The app icludes a sign in and sign up page. User can use his/her e mail and password to sign in/up. This information kept in Firebase to verify the user. If sign in completed succesfully, user can login to the app. If not, he/she gets an error message like, enter a valid email and password ect. After login, user can share a photo and a comment. But before selecting a photo app asks user for the permission to open the gallery. If he/she presses the upload button, app redirects the user to the feed page. Post's info also kept in the Firebase. If there are lots of shared photos, app sorts the pictures by the date. If he/she decides to log out, he/she can't see the posts anymore. But if user stays logged in then he/she doesn't need to enter email and password everytime that app opens.
