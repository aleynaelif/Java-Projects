 The projects that I developed during the mobile app development course
 
This file includes several different projects developed for educational purposes. 

Project 1 - Cathcing Game

 It's a simple game. The user tries to score by clicking on the image. But there is a countdown so player should click on the picture before it disappears. Player also should be quick because picture appears randomly. If player clicks fast enough then he/she gets points.I used a grid layout which has 9 images of Bojack. And randomly 8 of this images disappears so user can't click on them. Only one of the images is visible. When the time is over, player can't click on anything. If user wants to play again, he/she can select the yes button in the window that pops open when the game ends. Yes button starts the game from the beginning. But if user selects the no option, the little message in the bottom says game is over.
